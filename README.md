# Why
I very much enjoy idea of working in Haskell or functional languages in general.
You can [hire me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rados%C5%82aw-cymer-b31915122/) with just a premise of working with _some_ FP.
Project like this seems interesting and non-trivial enough to have it as a great learning opportunity.
It also requires some knowledge of Computer Science, which I adamantly claim to possess in my résumés,
on top of Mathematics which is my background.

I needed a simple REPL for some stupid idea, but during the process I decided to write a full-fledged Lisp interpreter,
because I love the [eerie aura around Lisp](https://imgur.com/gallery/huZRM).
Last Lisp-like language I've used and have currently installed is Racket so why not choose Scheme as a [basis for grammar](https://www.scheme.com/tspl2d/grammar.html).

# What
It's going to be a Scheme interpreter with REPL, written in Haskell, using only basic libraries like parsec, hspec or [RIO](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/rio/).
Also it's a good idea to use the industry standards around, to prove that I can write production-grade quality code, so expect tests and CI.

# How
I have this bookmark saved since like 2015: [Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 Hours](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours/),
and so I decided it is finally time to follow through.
Fortunately, the content of the book is so outdated (libraries-wise) that it leaves a lot of to figure out on your own.
And so I am stumbling around, trying to get this working. GL & HF me.
